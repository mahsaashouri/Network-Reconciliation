# Forecasting Network Flow using Reconciliation and Flow Aggregation

This study introduces a novel approach to enhancing flow forecast accuracy within network structures at varying aggregation levels. By considering connections among nodes and potential correlations among series, our method ensures coherent forecasts through a new aggregation structure. Our proposed network aggregation and reconciled forecasts effectively manage large flows of network datasets by summarizing them into macro flows, aiding in data management, decision-making, and resource allocation. Evaluation of both real-world and simulated datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of reconciliation in improving forecast accuracy. Furthermore, our approach extends to scenarios involving multiple connected or disconnected sub-networks, providing a generalized aggregation methodology applicable to diverse fields such as traffic management.
