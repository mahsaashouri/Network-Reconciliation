# New Approach for Forecasting Network Flow using Flow Aggregation and Reconciliation

This study introduces a novel approach to enhancing flow forecast accuracy within network structures across varying aggregation levels. By considering the connections among nodes and potential correlations among series, our method ensures coherent forecasts through proper and new aggregation structures. Additionally, our proposed new flow aggregation approach can be considered an effective way to minimize unused links, thus assisting in flow management. This framework proves invaluable for managing extensive network datasets, offering insights for decision-making and resource allocation in diverse applications, such as traffic management. Evaluation of both real-world and simulated datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of reconciliation in improving forecast accuracy. Furthermore, our approach extends to scenarios involving multiple connected or disconnected sub-networks, providing a generalized aggregation methodology.
